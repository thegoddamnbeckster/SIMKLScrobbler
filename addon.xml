SIMKL Scrobbler for Kodi
Version: 7.4.0
Last Modified: 2026-02-14

CHANGELOG:
7.4.0 - Addon ID renamed from script.simkl to script.simkl.scrobbler
        - Renamed addon ID to script.simkl.scrobbler (more descriptive)
        - Updated all Addon() calls, RunScript() commands, context menu dependencies
        - ZIP installs to script.simkl.scrobbler/ folder in Kodi addons
        - IMPORTANT: Remove old script.simkl/ folder manually before installing
        - Includes all fixes from 7.3.4 (uninstall locks, 401 auth, IMDb IDs, logging)
7.3.4 - FIX: Uninstall fails + scrobbling 401s + version tracking
        - FIXED: Sync thread file locks prevented addon directory removal on uninstall
        - FIXED: Service shutdown waits for sync thread cleanup before exiting
        - FIXED: API auto-retries on 401 with fresh Addon() settings read
        - FIXED: Settings change triggers API token refresh for post-auth pickup
        - FIXED: IMDb ID validation (tt prefix, TMDb numeric detection)
        - FIXED: Scrobble stop checks API response before claiming watched
        - ALL module versions bumped to 7.3.4 with verbose tagged logging
7.3.3 - FIX: Scrobbling 401 errors and IMDb ID format
        - FIXED: API auto-retries on 401 by refreshing token from settings (handles post-auth timing)
        - FIXED: IMDb IDs now validated with tt prefix (Kodi TMDb scraper returns raw numbers)
        - FIXED: getIMDBNumber() pure numeric values correctly identified as TMDb IDs
        - FIXED: Scrobble stop no longer claims success when API returned error
        - FIXED: Falls back to /sync/history when /scrobble/stop fails
7.3.2 - HOTFIX: Username not retrieved after authentication
        - FIXED: fetch_username() couldn't read token from settings due to Kodi async write timing
        - FIXED: Token now passed in-memory to fetch_username() instead of re-reading settings
        - FIXED: Username and success status returned directly from dialog to default.py
        - FIXED: auth_status now set from dialog return values, not stale settings re-read
        - Dialog shows "Authenticated as <username>!" on success
7.3.1 - HOTFIX: Auth dialog closing immediately
        - FIXED: NameError crash (max_attempts referenced outside thread scope)
        - FIXED: Dialog now stays open up to 15 minutes for PIN/QR auth
        - FIXED: Separated API error handler from polling to prevent cascade close
        - IMPROVED: Cancel responds within 500ms instead of waiting full poll interval
        - IMPROVED: Time remaining shows minutes:seconds format
7.3.0 - BUG FIXES: Authentication & Settings
        - FIXED: QR code now generated via API (removed broken pyqrcode dependency)
        - FIXED: PIN authentication polling with improved response handling
        - FIXED: Missing rating settings (Rate TV Shows, Minimum View Time, Re-rating)
        - REMOVED: script.module.pyqrcode dependency (never existed in Kodi repo)
        - Added detailed auth response logging for diagnostics
7.2.0 - PHASE 9: Advanced Features & Polish
        - ACTIVATED: All exclusion settings now functional
        - NEW: Exclude Live TV (pvr://) sources
        - NEW: Exclude HTTP/HTTPS streaming sources
        - NEW: Exclude plugin sources (plugin://)
        - NEW: Exclude script-controlled playback
        - NEW: Up to 5 custom path exclusions with cascading UI
        - RESTORED: Notifications category in settings
        - Version consistency: All modules now at 7.2.0
        - Fixed auth.py bug (VERSION -> __version__)
7.0.0 - PHASE 8: Localization Framework
        - NEW: Centralized localization helper (strings.py)
        - NEW: Complete English localization framework
        - All user-facing strings now use getLocalizedString()
        - Framework ready for future language additions
        - No functional changes - pure localization
        - Notifications: Localized all runtime messages
        - Rating Dialog: Localized all UI strings
        - Service: Localized sync and auth notifications
6.13.0 - Previous release
