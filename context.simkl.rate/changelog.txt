v1.0.1 (2025-12-27)
====================
CRITICAL FIX: Media Type Detection

FIXED:
- Changed from Container.Content() to ListItem.DBTYPE for media detection
- NOW WORKS: In all views (library, in progress, recently added, filtered lists)
- Container.Content() only works in main library views
- ListItem.DBTYPE works everywhere a media item exists

IMPROVED:
- Added VERSION constant for version tracking
- Added comprehensive logging with version prefix
- Added error logging for debugging
- Added try/except with full traceback on errors
- Renamed __getMediaType() to get_media_type() (PEP8 compliant)
- Added detailed docstrings
- Added null checks for DBID and media_type
- Professional code structure matching script.simkl standards

v1.0.0 (2025-12-27)
====================
INITIAL RELEASE: Context Menu Rating Button

NEW FEATURES:
- Adds "Rate on SIMKL" to context menu on media items
- Visible on movies, TV shows, seasons, episodes
- Delegates to script.simkl for rating functionality
- Proper addon structure (addon.xml, strings.po, icon, license)

ARCHITECTURE:
- Standalone context addon (required by Kodi)
